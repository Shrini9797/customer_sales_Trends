# Customer Sales Trends Analytics

## Overview
This project is designed to provide in-depth analysis of customer sales trends by leveraging advanced data modeling techniques and powerful visualization tools. By implementing both OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems, the project enables multi-dimensional analysis and transaction-level insights into customer behavior. The analytics are visualized through an intuitive GUI, making it easier to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Modeling**: Crafted robust data models optimized for both OLAP and OLTP systems to handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Executed complex SQL operations including server-side normalization, stored procedures, views, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to optimize data processing.
- **Sales Analytics Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards displaying sales metrics, allowing for real-time analysis of customer behavior and sales performance.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Analyzed customer demographics and purchase patterns to provide actionable insights for sales strategy improvements.
- **Trend Visualization**: Developed a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter and matplotlib to visualize sales trends and metrics dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and GUI development.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for implementing OLAP/OLTP systems and executing complex SQL queries.
- **Tkinter**: GUI library in Python for creating interactive dashboards.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **matplotlib**: Visualization library for plotting sales trends and analytics.
